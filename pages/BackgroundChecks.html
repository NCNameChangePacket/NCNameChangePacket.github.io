<h2>
    Background Checks
</h2>
<p>
    For a name change, you will need to get a state and a federal background check,
    and you will need to get fingerprinted for each. Once you get these results back, 
    you have 90 days to file your application for a name change with the court.
    Also, since you have not actually changed your name yet, you should be using your old name for
    these forms.

    National Identity History Summary

<p>
    This is your federal background check. It is fastest to complete it online.
    After submitting your request, you will get instructions for how to submit your fingerprints for this background check.

    Fingerprinting - Federal
</a></h4>
<p>
    Fingerprinting for federal background checks can be done at <i>some</i> post offices.
    You will need to do this <i>after</i> requesting your National Identity History Summary,
    as you will need your order confirmation number to register to get fingerprinted at the post office.
    <br><br>
    *You can skip this step by getting a second fingerprint card while getting your fingerprints for your state
    background check. However, you will have to mail that second fingerprint card, which will cause the federal background check
    to take <i>much</i> longer.

    Fingerprinting - State
</h4>
<p>
    You will need to find this on your own (sorry) as it varies by county 
    (but if you are in Wake county, you can get fingerprinted <a href="https://www.wake.gov/departments-government/city-county-bureau-identification-ccbi/fingerprinting-and-public-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
    You should get a fingerprint card from here that you will need to send with your Right to Review request.

    Right to Review
</a></h4>
<p>
    This is your request for a state background check 
    (found <a href="https://ncsbi.gov/Services/Background-Checks/Personal-Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). 
    You will need to mail this with your fingerprint card and either a certified check or money 
    order <i>after</i> you get your National Identity History Summary results back.
