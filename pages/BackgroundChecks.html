<h2>
    Background Checks
</h2>
<p>
    For a name change, you will need to get a state and 
    a federal background check,
    and you will need to get fingerprinted for each. 
    Once you get these results back, 
    you have 90 days to file your application for a name change 
    with the court.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> Since you have not actually changed your 
    name yet, you need to use your old name for
    these forms.

    National Identity History Summary
</a></h4>
<p>
    This is your federal background check. 
    It is fastest to complete it online, 
    but you can do it by mail. After submitting your request, 
    you will get an FBI order confirmation number and instructions 
    for how to submit your fingerprints for this background check.
    After sending your fingerprints, you will receive the results of 
    your background check by either email or physical mail.

    Fingerprinting - Federal
</a></h4>
<p>
    Fingerprinting for federal background checks requires a USPS 
    post office that offers fingerprinting service 
    (which can be found at the above link).
    You will need to do this <i>after</i> requesting your 
    National Identity History Summary,
    as you will need your order FBI order confirmation 
    number to register to get fingerprinted at the post office.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> You can skip this step by getting a 
    second fingerprint card while getting your 
    fingerprints for your state
    background check. However, you will have to mail 
    that second fingerprint card, which will cause 
    the federal background check
    to take <i>much</i> longer.

<h4>
    Fingerprinting - State
</h4>
<p>
    You will need to find this on your own (sorry) as it varies 
    by county (if you happen to live in Wake county, you can get 
    fingerprinted <a href="https://www.wake.gov/departments-government/city-county-bureau-identification-ccbi/fingerprinting-and-public-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
    You should get a fingerprint card from here that you will 
    need to send with your Right to Review request.

    Right to Review
</a></h4>
<p>
    This is your request for a state background check 
    (found <a href="https://ncsbi.gov/Services/Background-Checks/Personal-Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). 
    After you get your National Identity History Summary results 
    back, you will need to print and mail the final page of this form
    with your fingerprint card and either a certified check or money 
    order <i>after</i> you get your National Identity 
    History Summary results back. You will receive your results 
    back by mail.
