    Court Documents
</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have the results from your background checks, you can actually go about changing your name. 
    These are the documents that you will actually file with the court.
    You can find your courthouse <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        here</a> on the <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        NC Courts website</a>.
    This is also the site where all these forms can be found
    (<a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms?contains=name%20change&field_form_type_target_id=All&field_language_target_id=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
    Just to note, you <i>true name</i> is your old name and your <i>name sought</i> is your new name. Unless it says otherwise, you should
    be using your <i>true name</i> on these forms as you are still legally that name.

    Notice of Intent to Change Name
</a></h4>
<p>
    You will need to post this at courthouse at least 10 days before you submit your name change. 
    Once there, the clerks their will date it and give you directions for where to actually post it. You will need to get this back 
    when you return to courthouse so that you can file it with your name change application.

    Affidavit of Good Character</a> (x2)</h4>
<p>
    You will need two people (preferably not blood relatives) from your county to fill this out,
    stating how they know you and how you are <i>of good character</i>.

    As you have not yet changed your name yet, they should use your old name when talking about you for this form. 
</p>

    Application For Adult Name Change
</a></h4>
<p>
   This is the actual application for a name change.
    You will need to submit this with:<ul>
        <li>Your 10-day old Notice of Intent to Change Name</li>
        <li>2 Affidavit of Good Character</li>
        <li>The results of both of your background checks</li>
    </ul>
    You will also need to have:<ul>
        <li>A form of ID</li>
        <li>Your Birth Certificate</li>
        <li>A form of payment for the filing fee</li>
    </ul>
    If you don't feel comfortable mentioning your transness as your reason for changing your name (I didn't),
    you can say something to the effect of your "new" name being how people gernally refer to you
    and that you would like you legal documentation to match (which is true). From what I have read, as long as you're are not 
    changing your name to commit fraud, the court is pretty accepting of your resoning.
