<p>
    Hello. Welcome to my NC Name Change Packet.
    This was something I wish I had going through this process.
    Hopefully it will save you some of the struggling 
    I needed to go through to find all these forms.
    <br><br>
    For context, I went through this process while legally transitioning
    as an adult (the process is different for people under 18) and living in Wake county. 
    I am not a lawyer, and so I cannot give legal advice (although here are the 
    general statutes on name changes, 
    <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        G.S. 101</a>, if you are interested). That said, I am
        somebody who had to stumble through this complicated process.
        My hope is that this guide will help make this process (slightly) less complicated for you.
