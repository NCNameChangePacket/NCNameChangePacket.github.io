                    Hello. Welcome to my NC Name Change Packet.
                    This was something I wish I had going through this process.
                    Hopefully it will save you some of the struggling 
                    I needed to go through to find all these forms.
                    <br><br>
                    For context, I went through this process while legally transitioning
                    as an adult (the process is different for people under 18) and living in Wake county. 
                    I am not a lawyer, and so I cannot give legal advice (although here are the 
                    general statutes on name changes, 
                    <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        G.S. 101</a>, if you are interested). That said, I am
                        somebody who had to stumble through this complicated process.
                        My hope is that this guide will help make this process (slightly) less complicated for you.

                    For a name change, you will need to get a state and a federal background check,
                    and you will need to get fingerprinted for each.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is your federal background check. It is fastest to complete it on line.
                    After submitting your request, you will get instuction for how to submit you fingerprints for this background check.

                <p>
                    Fingerprinting for federal background checks can be done at <i>some</i> post offices.
                    You will need to do this <i>after</i> requesting your National Identity History Summary,
                    as you will need yoor order confirmation number to register to get fingerprinted at the post office.
                    <br><br>
                    *You can skip this step by getting a second fingerprint card while getting your fingerprints for your state
                    background check. However, you will have to mail that second fingerprint card, which will cause the federal background check
                    to take <i>much</i> longer.

                    You will need to find this on your own (sorry) as it varies be county 
                    (but if you are in Wake county, you can get fingerprinted <a href="https://www.wake.gov/departments-government/city-county-bureau-identification-ccbi/fingerprinting-and-public-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
                    You should get a fingerprint card from here that you will need to send with your Right to Review request.

                <p>
                    Now that you have your background checks' results, you can actually legally change your name. 
                    These are the documents that you will actually file with the court.
                    You can find your courthouse <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        here</a> on the <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                    This is also the site where all these forms can be found
                    (<a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms?contains=name%20change&field_form_type_target_id=All&field_language_target_id=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).

                </a></h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to post this at courthouse at least 10 days before you submit your name change.

                <p>
                    You will need two people (preferably not blood relatives) from your country to fill this out,
                    stating how they know you and how you are <i>of good character</i>.

                    As you have not yet changed your name yet, they should use your deadname when talking about you for this form.

                <p>
                    Self Explanatory, this is the actual application for a name change.
                    You will need to submit this with:<ul>
                        <li>You 10-day old Notice of Intent to Change Name</li>
                        <li>2 Affidavit of Good Character</li>
                        <li>The results of both of your background checks</li>
                    </ul>
                    You will also need to have:<ul>
                        <li>A form of ID</li>
                        <li>Your Birth Certificate</li>
                        <li>A form of payment for the filing fee</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you don't feel comfortable mentioning your transness as your reason for changing your name (I didn't),
                    you can say something to the effect of your "new" name being how people gernally refer to you
                    and that you would like you legal documentation to match (which is true). From what I have read, as long as your are not 
                    changing your name to commit fraud, they are pretty accepting of your resoning.
