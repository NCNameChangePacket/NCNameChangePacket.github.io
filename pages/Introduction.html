<p>
    Hello. Welcome to my NC Name Change Packet.
    This was something I wish I had going through this process.
    Hopefully it will save you some of the struggling 
    I needed to go through to find all these forms.
    <br><br>
    For context, I went through this process while legally transitioning
    as an adult (the process is different for people under 18) and living in Wake county. 
    I am not a lawyer, and so I cannot give legal advice (although here are the 
    general statutes on name changes, 
    <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        G.S. 101</a>, if you are interested). That said, I am
        somebody who had to stumble through this complicated process.
        My hope is that this guide will help make this process (slightly) less complicated for you.
        The information on this page is accurate as of March 2024.
