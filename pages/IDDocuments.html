<h2>
    ID Documents
</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have your court order, you need to go about updating all you ID documents.                 
</p>
<br>

<h4><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Social Security Card</a></h4>
<p>
    This was one of the easier documents to update. You can find your
    local social security office <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
    You will need to bring your court order.
    You will need to do it a few days before updating your driver's license
    since the social security database is where the DMV gets their data from.
    You can also change your sex marker without any other documentation.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    US Passport</a></h4>
<p>
    You will need to send you court order to change your name. At the same time, you can update 
    your gender marker without any other documentation (as of March 2024).
</p>

<h4>
    Driver's license</h4>
<p>
    You will want to make an appointment ASAP <a href="https://skiptheline.ncdot.gov/Webapp/Appointment/Index/a7ade79b-996d-4971-8766-97feb75254de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        here</a>. For the name change, you will need to bring your court order
        proving you name change. For your sex marker change, you need to bring an updated passport with the correct information on it
            (OR <a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/downloads/Documents/DL-300.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a> filled out, but the updated passport is much easier).
