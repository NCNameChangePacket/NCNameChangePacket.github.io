    <b>2025 UPDATE: Changing your name is done through state courts, so this <i>should</i> still be the same.</b>
    <br><br>
    Once you have the results from your background checks, 
    you can start the name change process, using documents
    that you will file with your county court.
    You can find your courthouse 
    <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        here</a> on the 
        <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        NC Courts website</a>.
    This is also the site where all these forms can be found
    (<a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms?contains=name%20change&field_form_type_target_id=All&field_language_target_id=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> Your <i>true name</i> is your old 
    name and your <i>name sought</i> is your new name. 
    Unless it says otherwise, you should
    be using your <i>true name</i> on these 
    forms as that name is still your legal name.

    Notice of Intent to Change Name
</a></h4>
<p>
    You will need to post this at the courthouse 
    at least 10 days before you submit your name change. 
    Once you're there, the clerks will date it and 
    give you directions for where to post it. 
    You will need to get this actual form back 
    when you return to the courthouse so that you 
    can file it with your name change application.

    Affidavit of Good Character</a> (x2)</h4>
<p>
    You will need to send this to two people 
    (preferably not blood relatives) from your 
    county and ask them to fill this out and return it to you. 
    In it, they will need to state how they know you and how 
    you are <i>of good character</i>.

    <b>Note:</b> As you have not yet changed your name yet, 
    be sure they know to use your old name when talking 
    about you for this form. 
</p>

    Application For Adult Name Change
</a></h4>
<p>
   This is the actual application for a name change.
    You will need to submit this with:<ul>
        <li>Your 10-day old Notice of Intent to Change Name</li>
        <li>2 Affidavit of Good Character</li>
        <li>The results of both of your background checks</li>
    </ul>
    You will also need to have:<ul>
        <li>A form of photo ID</li>
        <li>Your Birth Certificate</li>
        <li>A form of payment for the filing fee</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Note:</b> If you don't feel comfortable mentioning your transness as your reason for changing your name (I didn't),
    you can say something to the effect of your "new" name being how people generally refer to you
    and that you would like your legal documentation to match (which is true). From what I have read, as long as you're not 
    changing your name to commit fraud, the court is pretty accepting of your reasoning.
