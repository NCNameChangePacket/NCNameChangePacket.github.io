    Court Documents

<p>
    Now that you have your background checks' results, you can actually legally change your name. 
    These are the documents that you will actually file with the court.
    You can find your courthouse <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        here</a> on the <a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        NC Courts website</a>.
    This is also the site where all these forms can be found
    (<a href="https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms?contains=name%20change&field_form_type_target_id=All&field_language_target_id=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).

<h4><a href="./files/CourtDocuments/sp606-NoticeOfIntentToChangeName.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Notice of Intent to Change Name
</a></h4>
<p>
    You will need to post this at courthouse at least 10 days before you submit your name change.
</p>

<h4><a href="./files/CourtDocuments/sp607-AffidavitOfGoodCharacter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Affidavit of Good Character</a> (x2)</h4>
<p>
    You will need two people (preferably not blood relatives) from your country to fill this out,
    stating how they know you and how you are <i>of good character</i>.

    As you have not yet changed your name yet, they should use your deadname when talking about you for this form. 
</p>

<h4><a href="./files/CourtDocuments/sp604-ApplicationForAdultNameChange.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Application For Adult Name Change
</a></h4>
<p>
    Self Explanatory, this is the actual application for a name change.
    You will need to submit this with:<ul>
        <li>You 10-day old Notice of Intent to Change Name</li>
        <li>2 Affidavit of Good Character</li>
        <li>The results of both of your background checks</li>
    </ul>
    You will also need to have:<ul>
        <li>A form of ID</li>
        <li>Your Birth Certificate</li>
        <li>A form of payment for the filing fee</li>
    </ul>
    If you don't feel comfortable mentioning your transness as your reason for changing your name (I didn't),
    you can say something to the effect of your "new" name being how people gernally refer to you
    and that you would like you legal documentation to match (which is true). From what I have read, as long as your are not 
    changing your name to commit fraud, they are pretty accepting of your resoning.
