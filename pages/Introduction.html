    Welcome

<p>
    Hello. Welcome to my NC Name Change Packet.
    This was something I wish I had going through this process.
    Hopefully it will save you some of the struggling 
    I needed to go through to find all these forms.
    <br><br>
    For context, I went through this process while legally transitioning
    as an adult (the process is different for people under 18) and living in Wake County, NC in early 2024. 
    I am not a lawyer, and so I cannot give legal advice (although here are the 
    general statutes on name changes, 
    <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        G.S. 101</a>, if you are interested). That said, I am
        somebody who had to stumble through this complicated process.
        My hope is that this guide will help make this process (at least slightly) less complicated for you.

        2025 UPDATE: Obviously, some things have changed since early 2024 and I can't keep this fully up to date, but I'll try to point out the likely most affected parts. 
        Do your own research (sorry) to stay up to date in current legislation and government policy.
        Major changes are likely going to happen in the parts of this process interacting with the federal government,
         but the steps interacting with the state government should mostly stay the say (especially if you live in a more liberal area).
        <br>
        <br>
        Stay safe. We are going to get through this.
