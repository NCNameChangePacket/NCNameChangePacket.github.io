<h2>
    ID Documents
</h2>
<p>
    Once you have received your court order by mail, 
    you need to go about updating all your ID documents.                 
    At this point, you now are legally your new name, 
    so you should be using it on these forms
</p>
<br>

<h4><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Social Security Card</a></h4>
<p>
    This was one of the easier documents to update. 
    Your local social security office can be found 
     <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
    You will need to bring your court order and the 
    linked form. <s>While you are updating your name, 
    you can also change your sex marker without any 
    other documentation.</s> <b>2025 UPDATE: Social Security is a federal agency, so you likely can't change your sex marker anymore.</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Note: </b> You will need to do this at least a 
    few days before updating your driver's license
    since the DMV uses the social security 
    database for personal data.

<h4><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    US Passport</a></h4>
<p>
    There are a few different forms you could need 
    depending on your situation, so I can't just link a form here. 
    You can find which form you need by following these steps.
    <ol>
        <li>Click the link above.</li>
        <li>Click "Change name or correct an error"
            under "Get or replace a passport."
        </li>
        <li>Expand the "Change you name tab."</li>
        <li>Expand the section that applies to you 
            and follow the directions it provides for you.</li>
    </ol>
    
    You will need to send your court order, your old passport, 
    a new passport photo, and a check to cover the fees 
    (all of which should be on their website).
    While you can take and print your own passport photo, 
    I recommend googling to see if there are any nearby 
    places that can take passport photos, like Walgreens or CVS.
    <s>While you are updating your name, you can also update 
    your gender marker without any other documentation.</s> 
    <b>2025 UPDATE: Passports are handled by the federal government, so you likely can't change your sex marker anymore.</b>
</p>

<h4>
    Driver's license</h4>
<p>
    You will want to make an appointment ASAP 
    <a href="https://skiptheline.ncdot.gov/Webapp/Appointment/Index/a7ade79b-996d-4971-8766-97feb75254de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    here</a>. For the name change, you will need to 
    bring your court order proving your name change. 
    To update your sex marker, <s>you need to bring an 
    updated passport with the updated information on it</s> 
    (OR <a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/downloads/Documents/DL-300.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a> filled out, 
    <s>but the updated passport is much easier</s>). <b>2025 UPDATE: While
         driver's licenses is are handled by the state government, passports aren't (see above), so you will need an alternate method to update your sex marker. 
         You should be able to still fill out the linked form 
         (<a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/downloads/Documents/DL-300.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DL-300</a>).
          That said, I did not need to fill this out, so I can't provide much more help than that.
         Sorry.

<h4>Voter Registration</h4>
<p>
    You can do this while you are updating your 
    driver's license. If they don't ask you 
    about it, just mention it at the DMV and 
    they will handle it.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://vitalrecords.nc.gov/documents/NCOVR-BirthModificationsApplicationFinal-07072022v6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Birth Certificate</a></h4>
<p>
    You can update name and sex marker by mail 
    with the above form, as well as with your updated 
    passport, your court order, and a form of payment 
    (certified check or money order).
    Alternatively, you can visit them in person 
    at the NC Vital Records Building with 
    your updated passport and court order 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/225+N+McDowell+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27603/@35.7835389,-78.6467615,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sCooper+Memorial+Health+Building+225+N.+McDowell+St.+Raleigh,+NC+27603-1382!3m6!1s0x89ac5f6932db0ff7:0xf2b17d6fe9298809!8m2!3d35.7835346!4d-78.6418906!15sCkpDb29wZXIgTWVtb3JpYWwgSGVhbHRoIEJ1aWxkaW5nIDIyNSBOLiBNY0Rvd2VsbCBTdC4gUmFsZWlnaCwgTkMgMjc2MDMtMTM4MpIBEWNvbXBvdW5kX2J1aWxkaW5n4AEA!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v5knzg?entry=ttu" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> 
    if you are near Raleigh. If you do visit in person, 
    you may want to print the entire form (not just 
    the first page) since the 
    person helping you there may not be aware 
    that you can update sex designation with 
    just an updated passport, as it says on page 6 
    (speaking from experience). 
    <b>2025 UPDATE: Birth certificates are handled by the state government, but  passports aren't (see above), 
        so you will need an alternate method to update your sex marker.
        See page 6 of the linked form to see alternative methods to correct your sex designation
