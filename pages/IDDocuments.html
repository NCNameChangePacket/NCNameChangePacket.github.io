<h2>
    ID Documents
</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have your court order, you need to go about updating all your ID documents.                 
</p>
<br>

<h4><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Social Security Card</a></h4>
<p>
    This was one of the easier documents to update. Your local social security office can be found 
     <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
    You will need to bring your court order and the linked form. While you are updating your name, 
    you can also change your sex marker without any other documentation. It is important to note that
    you will need to do this at least a few days before updating your driver's license
    since the social security database is where the DMV gets their data from.

<h4><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    US Passport</a></h4>
<p>
    After clicking the above link, go to "Change name or correct and error" under "Get or replace a passport." From there,
    expand the "Change your Name tab," then expand the section that applies to you and follow the directions it provides for you.
    You will need to send your court order, your old passport, a passport photo, and a check to cover the fees (all of which should be on their website).
    While you can take and print your own passport photo, I recommend googling to see if there are any nearby places that can take passport photos, like Walgreens or CVS.
    While you are updating your name, you can also update your gender marker without any other documentation. 
</p>

<h4>
    Driver's license</h4>
<p>
    You will want to make an appointment ASAP <a href="https://skiptheline.ncdot.gov/Webapp/Appointment/Index/a7ade79b-996d-4971-8766-97feb75254de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    here</a>. For the name change, you will need to bring your court order proving you name change. For your sex marker change, 
    you need to bring an updated passport with the correct information on it
    (OR <a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/downloads/Documents/DL-300.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a> filled out, 
    but the updated passport is much easier).
    </a>
</p>

<h4>Voter Registration</h4>
<p>
    You can do this while you are updating your driver's license. Assuming they don't ask you about it, just mention it at the DMV and they will handle it.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://vitalrecords.nc.gov/documents/NCOVR-BirthModificationsApplicationFinal-07072022v6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Birth Certificate</a></h4>
<p>
    You can update name and sex marker by mail with the above form, as well as with your updated passport, your court order, and a form of payment (certified check or money order).
    Alternatively, you can visit them in person with your updated passport and court order 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/225+N+McDowell+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27603/@35.7835389,-78.6467615,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sCooper+Memorial+Health+Building+225+N.+McDowell+St.+Raleigh,+NC+27603-1382!3m6!1s0x89ac5f6932db0ff7:0xf2b17d6fe9298809!8m2!3d35.7835346!4d-78.6418906!15sCkpDb29wZXIgTWVtb3JpYWwgSGVhbHRoIEJ1aWxkaW5nIDIyNSBOLiBNY0Rvd2VsbCBTdC4gUmFsZWlnaCwgTkMgMjc2MDMtMTM4MpIBEWNvbXBvdW5kX2J1aWxkaW5n4AEA!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v5knzg?entry=ttu" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you are near Raleigh. If you do visit in person, you may want to print the entire form (not just the first page) since the 
    person helping you there may not be aware that you can update sex designation with just an updated passport (as it says on page 6).
